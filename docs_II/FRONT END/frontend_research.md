# FRONTEND RESEARCH

by Aobakwe Keeme

## PRIMARY USERS.


The primary users of the system are the shop owners, government officials and
consumers.

- Shop owners: entrepreneurs who own a spaza shop.
- Government officials: representatives from the government who oversee the
    registration and compliance of spaza shops.
- Consumers: customers who purchase from spaza shops.

## FLAWS OF CURRENT SYSTEM (CIPC).

I picked two bad characteristics of the CIPC system:

- High click depth.
- Information overloaded.

> A high click depth and too much information on the homepage makes it hard to locate a page you want, 
> which can negatively impact user experience and search engine optimization.

> The solution for these defects is to make the homepage as simple and detailed as
> possible and minimize the number of links.

## USERS SCREENS.

- Shop Owners: Registration screen, business dashboard, compliance checklist.
- Government Officials: Dashboard for monitoring registrations, compliance
reports, user management interface.
- Consumers: Shop locator, complaint or compliment form, safety compliance
information, and user ratings.

## INTERFACES TO BE DESIGNED.
- Shop Owner Interface: registration, compliance, and business management.
- Government Official Interface: Monitoring and reporting tools.
- Consumer Interface: Shop discovery, feedback, and safety information.

## HOW WILL DATA BE DISPLAYED AND MANAGED IN THE USER INTERFACE.

- Dashboards: Visual representations of key metrics.
- Forms: For data entry, structured with clear labels and instructions.
- Tables: For lists of shops, compliance records, and user feedback.

##  KEY USER ROLES.

- Shop Owners: Manage registration, compliance status, and customer
    interactions.
- Government Officials: Oversee registrations, compliance checks, and generate
    reports.
- Consumers: Provide feedback and access information about shops.

## SUMMARY INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE NOTED AND INCLUDE ON THE PROGRAMMING.

- User Summaries: user profile, registration status, roles and permissions.
- Operational Metrics: registration, compliance and user engagement metrics.
- Feedback and Reporting: feedback summary and improvement suggestions.
- Technical Documentation: architecture overview, technology stack and
    integration points.
- Security Information: data protection measures, access control lists and audit
    trails.
- Performance Metrics: load times and scalability information.
- User Assistance Information: help resources and contact details.

## FRONT-END TECHNOLOGIES AND FRAMEWORKS THAT WILL BE BEST SUITED FOR SCALABILITY.

- HTML for the structure of the application.
- React for dynamic user interfaces.
- Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive design.

## SECURITY MEASURES TO BE BUILT INTO THE FRONT END.

- Implement SSL encryption for data transmission.
- Use role-based access control to limit data access based on user roles.
- Regularly update security protocols to protect sensitive data.

## HOW CAN THE SYSTEM ADAPT TO DIFFERENT SCREEN SIZES AND DEVICES?

By ensuring the system uses responsive design principles to adapt to various screen
sizes, with media queries to adjust layouts and navigation for different devices.


## BEST PRACTICES IN RESPONSIVE DESIGN, COLOUR CONTRAST, READABILITY, AND NAVIGATION.

- Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards.
- Use readable fonts and maintain a logical flow in navigation.
- Keep interactive elements easily accessible.

## HOW CAN THE FRONT-END BE OPTIMIZED FOR PERFORMANCE AND FAST LOADING SPEEDS?

- Implement lazy loading for images and assets to improve initial load times.
- Use caching strategies to store frequently accessed data.
- Optimize asset delivery by minifying CSS, JS, and images.

## WHAT FEATURES CAN MAKE THE PRODUCT OF THIS PROJECT A SUCCESS?

- Digital Verification System: Integrate with government databases for identity
    verification.
- Multi-User Support: Allow multiple shop owners to manage their registrations
    collaboratively.
- Mobile Optimization: Ensure the platform is fully functional on mobile devices.
- AI & Automation Features: Use AI for chat support and automated compliance
    checks.
- Compliance Monitoring & Alerts: Implement notifications for compliance
    deadlines.
- Customer Engagement: Include a community forum for consumers to share
    experiences.
- Offline Mode Support: Allow users to access certain features without internet
    connectivity.
- Mimic Government Databases: Integrate with existing government systems for
    seamless data sharing.
