Sprint Backlog - Spaza Shop Management System
(SSMS)

SPRINT P1
A time-boxed schedule that outlines the team's goals, tasks, and deliverables for a 
specific sprint, usually spanning 1–2 weeks.
SPRINT BACLOG
A prioritized list of tasks and user stories selected for implementation during the 
sprint, including estimated time and assignees
Sprint 1 – Research & Team Brainstorming (Completed)
Duration: Tasks are delivered on Mondays and are to be presented on Fridays 
Meetings: Held on Microsoft Teams on Fridays.
SPRINT 1 OUTCOME REVIEW SUMMARY
Sprint 1 focused on role-based research to explore the challenges and requirements 
of a spaza shop regulation system in South Africa. Each team member investigated 
specific aspects aligned with their roles (e.g., testing, UI, backend, system design), 
resulting in a well-rounded understanding of the ecosystem. By the end of the week, 
members presented their findings in a collaborative Friday Teams meeting, where 
they brainstormed core ideas and established a unified product vision. The session 
helped lay the groundwork for upcoming design and development phases.

Sprint 1 Retrospective
What Went Well
-Team members completed their individual research effectively, providing strong 
foundational insights based on their assigned roles.
-The Friday meeting was successfully held, and everyone presented their findings, 
which helped establish a clear and unified project vision.
-The brainstorming session allowed the team to align on potential system features 
and user needs, setting the stage for structured development in upcoming sprints.
-Despite communication gaps earlier in the week, the team showed initiative during 
presentations and contributed meaningfully to discussions.
What Could Be Improved
-GitHub and documentation setup were delayed due to a lack of early direction and 
clarity on folder structure expectations from project manager.
-Research submissions were not shared in advance, which limited meaningful 
feedback during the Friday meeting.
-Overlapping research areas led to redundant findings, highlighting the need for 
better task scoping and coordination.
-Inconsistent team communication during the week caused delays in confirming 
responsibilities and slowed overall progress toward early deliverables.
Action Items
-Finalize and share GitHub folder structures by before the start of Sprint 2.
-Begin sharing individual progress by Thursday to allow feedback ahead of Friday 
meetings on the genesis group.
-Set up a lightweight Monday check-in via group chat to align before Friday 
reviews...

Sprint 2
Outcome Review Summary: Sprint 2 Has began the design and 
planning phase for the Spaza Shop Regulatory & Management System (SSRMS). The 
goal of this sprint was to visualize the system through wireframes, create flow 
diagrams, and define how users will navigate the interface.
-Team members are currently following a sequential workflow: the System Designer 
initiates design drafts, which are then reviewed by the Front-End Developer and 
finally evaluated for back-end feasibility. 
-Members are collaborating via Teams and the Genesis WhatsApp group to provide 
design feedback and approve progress across roles.
Sprint 2 Retrospective
What’s Going Well
-The team has adopted the sequential UI review flow (System Designer → Front-End 
→ Back-End).
-Members are making use of visual tools (Figma, Balsamiq) to translate research into 
wireframes.
-Communication structure is more defined, with tasks being reported on Friday 
meetings.
What Could Be Improved
-GitHub updates have been inconsistent across team members.
-Wireframe description document is pending, slowing the Front-End handoff.
-Some delays occurred due to uncoordinated progress updates mid-week.
Action Items
-Enforce GitHub usage with timely commits and folder structure verification.
-Submit visual assets and markdown files to be review

Sprint 3 Retrospective (planned)
What’s Expected to Go Well
-Build upon UI wireframes to map functional behaviours and user needs.
-Use refined roles and clearer communication structures from Sprint 2.
Risks to Watch
-Lack of clarity in story-to-feature mapping could delay system architecture.
-Overload of unassigned architecture tasks if scoping isn't clear early on.
Action Items (Planned)
-Assign persona/story writing early in the sprint to the Tester.
-Use diagrams early to support developer architecture discussions and confirm tech 
stack with justifications for front-end and back-end compatibility.
