A BREAKDOWN OF FEATURES CATEGORIZIED INTO 

1.MUST 
The SSMS must include core features that are non-negotiable to ensure the system fulfills its purpose of safeguarding communities and regulating spaza shop activities. 
First, shop registration is essential to keep an official record of all spaza shops, including owner identity, location, nationality, and licensing status. 
Another must-have is product inventory monitoring, which allows the system to track each product sold, monitor expiry dates, and log supplier details to detect counterfeit or expired goods. 
A complaint reporting tool is vital for the public to report harmful or suspicious products directly, possibly with images.
In addition, the system must support inspection scheduling and record-keeping, so health officers can log visits, violations, and penalties accurately. 
Strong authentication and role-based access control is necessary to secure the platform for different users â€” such as government officials, shop owners, and community members. 
Lastly, the system must send real-time alerts and notifications for issues like expired products, and include a dashboard displaying compliance data, violation hotspots, and active cases.

2.SHOULD 
While not essential for the initial version, the SSMS should include features that significantly improve its effectiveness. 
A key feature is vendor verification, especially for products made in informal or home-based settings. 
This ensures that such goods meet minimum safety requirements. 
Similarly, a brand authentication check using barcode scans would help verify whether products are genuine or fake.
Multilingual support is another important addition, ensuring the system is usable by people across all language groups in South Africa. 
A mobile app version would greatly improve access, allowing inspectors and community members to engage with the system in real time.
Another helpful feature would be community feedback ratings, allowing customers to rate shops based on safety and cleanliness, encouraging responsible behavior through public accountability.

3.COULD
In future versions, the SSMS could integrate features that add long-term value and community engagement. 
One such feature is AI-driven risk prediction, which would analyze trends to flag high-risk shops before harm occurs. 
The system could also host an e-learning portal, providing training modules on hygiene, compliance, and ethical business practices for shop owners.
To further encourage good practices, a rewards system could offer digital badges or discounts to compliant shops. Including a live chat support system would make it easier for users to get help quickly, 
while integration with local community watch or WhatsApp groups could strengthen the link between digital monitoring and physical community safety efforts.
