Mapping of Features TO FUNCTIONAL & NON-FUNCTION REQUIREMENTS 
 Functional Requirements
The functional requirements define the specific actions and tasks the system must be able to perform. For the Spaza Shop Monitoring System (SSMS), these include:

User Registration and Authentication: The system must allow shop owners, government inspectors, and community members to register and log in securely,
with role-based access to different functions.
Spaza Shop Registration Module: Enables capturing detailed shop information such as ownership, location, nationality, licensing status, and business category.
Product Inventory Tracking: Allows for logging and tracking of every product sold in a spaza shop, including brand names, expiry dates, supplier info, 
and whether the product was home-made.
Complaint Reporting System: Enables community members to report expired or suspicious products using text, pictures, or location details.
Inspection Scheduling and Logging: Provides government officials a platform to schedule inspections, log findings, issue fines or warnings,
and track compliance over time.
Real-Time Alerts & Notifications: Sends alerts to the public or inspectors when harmful products are reported or violations are detected.
Dashboard and Analytics Display: Summarizes shop compliance, complaints, product safety data, 
and geographic hotspots through charts and interactive visual tools.
Barcode or Product Authenticity Scanner: Allows users to verify the authenticity of branded products sold in spaza shops.
Language Selection Options: Enables users to select their preferred language from supported South African languages for better accessibility.
Feedback and Rating System: Allows users to rate shops and leave feedback based on cleanliness, compliance, and product safety.


Non-Functional Requirements
The non-functional requirements describe how the system should operate rather than what it should do. These ensure quality, performance, and usability.
Performance & Scalability: The SSMS must handle thousands of users and support high traffic during peak reporting periods without crashing or slowing down.
Security & Data Protection: Strong encryption, secure login, and role-based permissions must be implemented to protect sensitive data, especially health violation records 
and user identities.
Reliability & Uptime: The system must be reliable, with minimal downtime to ensure 24/7 access for community members and government officials.
Usability: The interface must be simple, intuitive, and mobile-friendly, especially for people with limited digital skills.
Multi-language support is essential for inclusivity.
Maintainability: The system should be designed in a modular and well-documented way, so updates and bug fixes can be done efficiently by developers.
Data Accuracy & Validation: All input data (e.g., expiry dates, ID numbers) must be validated to avoid errors, with automated systems to prevent tampering.
Interoperability: The system should be compatible with government inspection tools, GPS systems, and possibly payment/licensing platforms for future growth.
Responsiveness: Both the web and mobile versions must be fast, with page load times under 3 seconds to accommodate users in areas with low bandwidth.
